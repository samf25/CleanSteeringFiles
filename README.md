# Muon Collider Steering Files

This repository contains the **Steering Files** required to run the complete Muon Collider Software Stack. These files orchestrate each stage of the workflow, from event generation through simulation, digitization, and reconstruction.

## Overview

The Muon Collider Software Stack is organized into the following stages:

1. **Generation**  
    Configure and control event generation for muon collider studies.

2. **Simulation**  
    Set up detector and physics simulations using industry-standard tools.

3. **Digitization**  
    Convert simulated detector responses into digitized signals.

4. **Reconstruction**  
    Reconstruct physics objects and events from digitized data.

## Repository Structure

```
steering-files/
├── generation/
├── simulation/
├── digitization/
└── reconstruction/
```

Each directory contains steering files and configuration examples for its respective stage.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-org/muon-collider-steering-files.git
    ```
2. Follow the instructions in each subdirectory's README to use the steering files with your preferred software stack.
